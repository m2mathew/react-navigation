# React Navigation

Assignment from The Iron Yard-Austin

Week 7 - day 26

## Description
Built out a navigation bar that responds to events.


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand how classes that extend Backbone.Events work.
* Understand how to listen for page change events.
* Understand how to send information from one component to another.
* Pass information into components using properties.


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Backbone router
* Backbone.Events
* Parse.User.current()
* .trigger(...)


## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `scripts/main.js`
  * `index.html`

### Requirements

* No ESLint warnings or errors


## Normal Mode
Fork and clone this repository. After cloning, cd into the new directory and run the tiyfe command.

You will need to add your own parse API tokens using `Parse.initialize(...)` in the scripts/main.js file in order for this code to work.

In this assignment you will implement an event driven navigation component. The navigation should change depending on:

1. What page the user is on.
2. Whether or not the user is logged in.

Reference the screen shots below to understand how the navigation component should behave:

#### Logged out
![logged out](/images/loggedout.jpg)
*Notice how the logout and dashboard pages are hidden*

#### Logged in
![logged in](/images/loggedin.jpg)
*Notice how the login and register pages are hidden*

#### Register page
![register](/images/register.jpg)
*Notice how the register page is active*

#### Dashboard page
![dashboard](/images/dashboard.jpg)
*Notice how the dashboard page is active*
